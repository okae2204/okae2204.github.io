        <!-- sorry this is all a text block -->
            <p>
                The unfocused voice of a mother gushing and crying over the loss of her dear son. If only she knew half the shit he did. How much of a piece of shit he was. The closed casket sits next to her, with a picture of his face sitting on top acting as the only recognisable piece of him. It’s a miracle his body was identified in the first place. The mother finally stops her speech and is guided back to her pew.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Does anyone have any final words for our dear lost Percy?’ asks the priest as he makes his way back to the podium.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next to me Oliver stands and make his way to the podium, fidgeting with the speech folded in his hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Dear Percy,’ Oliver chokes out and takes a deep breath before he continues again, ‘We’ve known each other since our 4th year of school, and I’ve been along side you ever since. Watching you grow in to the man you’ve become. I was there for your first crush when you were 10, I was there for your first fight when you were 12. I was there for you to tell me about your first girlfriend, and after your first breakup. I was there when you got your acceptance letter.’
            </p>
            <p>
                He pauses, glancing around the room. His eyes find mine, and as disgusted as I am with the boy were mourning, I can’t help but give Oliver a little nod.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘fuuuuck…’ He says under his breath. ‘What I’m trying to say is, I’ve been there almost your whole life. Through the ups and downs. And yet I wasn’t there to say goodbye– I’m sorry, I can’t– I can’t do this.’
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside, Oliver and I stand in front of the church with the rest of Percy’s family. His eyes still stained red from tears held back. I look down more interested in the slush of snow beneath my boots than the sorrow around me. The way the dreary grey UK sky slightly illuminates the church beside us is comically perfect for the theme of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Y’know, maybe it’s for the best that he’s gone.” I say to Oliver, still looking at my boots.</p>
            <p>
                ‘Excuse me?’ He snaps back.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You heard me, maybe it’s better he’s gone.”
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘How can you even begin to say that.’
            </p>
            <p>
                “I know you two were pretty close,” I say as I finally look back at him the tears start to fill his eyes again, “Really close sometimes, but you have to admit he was kind of an ass.”
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Katelyn!’ He chokes out, fully holding back tears now.
            </p>
            <p>
                I almost want to feel bad for him. Almost. But then I remember the rage I felt around Percy, the disgust that came from the sight of him. I feel sorry for the people who have to be around him, and I pity those that chose to be around him. Especially Oliver, such a sweet soul and yet it seems all of his energy is spent trying to please Percy. I definitely did Oliver a favour taking care of Percy for him, so he never has to spend another breath on a man who can’t even seem to care about his friend, or … I don’t even know how to begin to explain what they were.

                California. A home that isn’t really home. A state that really should be it’s own country. And yet still it has a hold on my heart. I love this place, even with all of it’s issues, but I crave nothing more than to leave. Maybe it’s the trauma, or the urge to get as far away from my father as possible. My bags stuffed full, boxes overflowing. I might be rethinking how much stuff I should bring with me. How much do I really want to pay for checked luggage?
            </p>
            <p>
                Who am I kidding, I’m not the one paying for it. Time and time again my father  insists on buying his way back into my life. And time and time again I keep telling him money isn’t going to get me back into his life. And while I fight my way through life, paycheck to paycheck, worrying about how many checked bags is too much, the reality is having an upper class father means unlimited free checked bags. Along with paying for a third of a car I already had all of the cash for, along with moving to the other side of the planet for most of my childhood, only to return in my teens. And while I understand the amount of kids who would kill to have this issue to not have to worry about money, all I wanted was a father. A father who was there to raise me, and my sisters.
            </p>
            <p>
                I take one last look around my bland, empty room. A pile of boxes lying in the corner, my suitcase and duffle laying open in front of me. My now empty bookshelf stands oddly against the wall, the books carefully packed in a box beside it. The tapestry and flags once hung on my wall now folded up and taking up valuable room in my bags. My desk cleared off, computer packed up, paintings stored away, any sign that I once lived in this room erased. I’ve dreamed of leaving this room for years, and now that it’s finally happening, everything feels strange and uncertain. I’ve wanted nothing more than to flee across the Atlantic, to a country who doesn’t insist on suppressing my rights. A country that doesn’t pretend to be a democracy when it’s actually an oligarchy. And somehow I landed on the UK? Practically the exact opposite of what I’m looking for, being a monarchy, holding states hostage in a union who want to leave, leaving another union just cause. And instead of erasing all of the history before all of the white people arrived, they just stole it from every other country and culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two tightly packed bags and five boxes stuffed into the back of my Mazda later, my father and I are off to the airport.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over 10 hours in this plane. Awkwardly locked in an aluminium tube, shooting through the sky at 900km/h, with my father. What am I thinking? Is free checked luggage really worth spending most of my waking day with the man who chose to abandon us. I’d rather be strapped to this chair next to my ex, but this is somehow worse.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You excited?” He says to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Huh?” I say, more focused on the seat back in front of me than whatever he has to say right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Are you excited?” He repeats.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Umm, yea I am.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s a big move. Living in a different country is no small feat.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yea, I know” There’s a long pause as a few passengers shuffle around behind us, grabbing a laptop from the overhead bins or something similar.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’m gonna miss you.” He says after a few minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I know… me too”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Look, I know I haven’t always been there for you, and I’m sorry. But I did what I thought was best for you guys.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “If living in hotels across China for most of my childhood is what you thought was best for us, that’s fine by me. But think about the girls, and how much work it took to get them back in your life. At this point in my life it doesn’t really matter, I just wanted a father but instead I got a man who thinks being a walking wallet will get me to like him again.” I snapped. <i>Fuck, I said the quiet part out loud didn’t I?</i> The person across the aisle from us shifts around, making it very obvious that they were listening in.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’m sorry Kate.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Look,” I sigh, “It means a lot to me that you’re moving me across the globe. But you didn’t have too.”
