To the fallen,</p>
        <p>
I finally understand how it feels to have your entire country turn their back on you. And not in the empathetic sort of way. I understand in the sense that history is repeating itself, again. Last night I watched as this country voted for a man whose only goal was to bring back fascism, to become a dictator. How could we ignore all of the warnings? Our media, our books, hell our music has been warning about this for years, decades, centuries even. And yet, all have been ignored. How many times have people had to clarify that we shouldn’t strive for a world like this? How many times?</p>
        <p>
I get that it was fiction, but that fiction was loosely based on reality. We really shouldn’t base reality on fiction.</p>
        <p>
I now truly understand the feeling of losing all hope for humanity, of being overwhelmed with the decision to hide or to flee. And the thought of losing my family, found and given, is so overwhelming. I’ve been at a loss for words. I want to leave, I know I should, but I still have so much I wish I could do here. I simply don’t have the time. Maybe I’m lucky that the hate of my people is known to the rest of the world, so we have grounds to leave, but it feels too early. He’s still not in power, so no damage has yet to be done. I’m tired of this; of living through history instead of just studying it.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
        <div class='writing'>
        <p>
        I rip the paper out of the typewriter and hold it in my hand for a minute, looking at the letter I just wrote. Though I know exactly what it says, I can barely read it. The lines of text blend together as the disassociation sets in again. How many times have we been through this? Every time so much was lost. Each time millions of people erased, so much technology destroyed, so much knowledge burned. And to think we’ll never learn. I crumple the paper in my hands and throw it in the fireplace beside me, watching as the letter slowly dissolves into ash.</p>
        <p>
My wife and I have been mourning this loss for the past few days. Both of us were in shock over the results of the election. And the rumours started not long after. People wondered if all the votes were counted, if it was rigged. But these rumours resurface after every public vote. Only this time feels different. The newspaper I write for has been flooded with letters asking if the results were true, or if there had been fraud or a miscount.</p>
        <p>
I shake my head a little to interrupt the thoughts and walk into our little kitchen in the corner of our flat. It’s nothing much, just a wood fire stove, a small ice box, and some counter space to prepare our meals. I grab a few logs and toss them into the stove, along with an old newspaper to act as a fire starter. Once the fire’s lit, I grab the kettle sitting on the stove, fill it with water, and set it back on the stove to boil.</p>
        <p>
Quietly, I walk into our bedroom to check on Lauren. It’s a small room, so small that we can barely fit our bed, the vanity, the armoire, and still have room to walk. Even though it’s midday, the room is dim and only a small sliver of light peeks through the closed curtains, slightly illuminating the hints of red in Lauren's hair. Slowly I climb into bed and wrap my arms around her, holding her, taking in this moment as if it’s the last time I’ll ever get to hold her like this. Oddly enough she’s freezing underneath all of the blankets. I feel her heartbeat quicken and her sigh beside me as she turns into me.</p>
        <p>
“Hi, darling.” I say softly, “You doing okay?”</p>
        <p>
She only nods slightly in the crook of my neck.</p>
        <p>
“Do you want anything? Food? Drink?” I ask, rubbing my thumb along her back softly.</p>
        <p>
“I’m okay.” she says, her voice still groggy.</p>
        <p>
“Okay.” I sigh, “I’m boiling water if you decide you do.”</p>
        <p>
Almost as if on cue, the screech of boiling water sounds from the kitchen. Gently I kiss her forehead and groan as I start to sit up. Lauren watches me get up and rolls onto her back as I start to leave the room.</p>
        <p>
“Sasha?” she calls out.</p>
        <p>
“Yes, love?”</p>
        <p>
She pauses for a second before she answers. “Can you make me hot chocolate?”</p>
        <p>
I smile. Finally, she’ll have something. “Everything for you.”</p>
        <p>
I walk back out to the kitchen, and pull the still screeching kettle off the stove. I grab a bar of chocolate to my left, milk from the icebox below, as well as the little tin of black tea sitting next to it. To my right I grab a small saucepan, and two mismatched mugs from the cupboard above. One of them, ceramic with flowers and a skull painted on it. It was a gift from Lauren for my last birthday. The other is a clay mug in the shape of a frog I found randomly in the market a few moons back.</p>
        <p>
I break a few pieces of the chocolate and drop them into the pan along with a bit of the milk. While I wait for it to simmer I open the jar of tea and scoop out the last little bit into an infuser and plop it in my mug, along with some of the water from the kettle.</p>
        <p>
Suddenly, I feel Lauren's arms wrap around my waist, her hands rest on my stomach, and her head rests on my shoulder.</p>
        <p>
“Do you need help with anything?” She asks.</p>
        <p>
“No, just trying to figure out what we’d want for supper?” I respond and rest my head against hers.</p>
        <p>
“Mmmm”, she hums as she spins me around to face her. “We have some pasta left. Is there anything that needs to be eaten?”</p>
        <p>
“Not that I can think of. I do need to go to the market though. We’re out of some stuff. Anything you want me to grab?”</p>
        <p>
“Maybe just some bread. Or a baguette if they have any.”</p>
        <p>
“Okay, I'll be back soon then.” I say before I pull her in for a kiss. “I love you.”</p>
        <p>
“I love you too.”</p>
        <p>
The usually bustling market square has been deathly quiet the last few days. As if there is a thin veil laid over the city, with only the sound of footsteps and the quiet banter of merchants and customers emanating from the streets. Vendors barely promote their wares, if at all. Collectively we mourn the coming death of our country. Even those who’ve supported the soon to be dictator, have been eerily quiet since the news broke.</p>
        <p>
Our city sits on a small hill, the chill of the late autumn wind flowing through the street.
Slowly, and quietly, I make my way through the market, looking for vendors with bread and vegetables. The once familiar city now seems so foreign to me. People's faces who I’ve seen at least a dozen times now are those of strangers. Is this what it feels like to live in a city that isn’t yours? I stop at a stall I’ve bought from many times before, and look through some jars of spices and teas, some of which have been in high demand since our neighbours have placed embargoes on our ports. I grab a jar of black tea and wave over the vendor.</p>
        <p>
“How much for this?” I ask.</p>
        <p>
“Three silver.” The clerk says.</p>
        <p>
“And for this?” I say, picking up a small jar of crushed herbs.</p>
        <p>
“Five sil—”</p>
        <p>
A loud bang sounds from the next street over and a dozen or so large men, dressed in all black, emerge from the corner, all but two carrying rifles, the others holding red flags with a black star surrounded by a white circle. A few people start to scream, and suddenly another loud bang pierces my ears, a woman falls to the floor. One of the men reloads his rifle, the bullet casing making a small almost silent ping as it hits the ground. Panic erupts throughout the square. Time seems to freeze, or maybe I do.</p>
        <p>
Why the fuck are they here? They got what they wanted, they won the election. Why are they here now?</p>
        <p>
A few of the shooters turn towards us and raise their guns in our direction, and without thinking I run, the two jars still in my hand. The vendor yells towards me but ducks under his stall as the shooters start to walk in our direction. All I can hear is my heartbeat pounding in my head, but I still feel bullets being fired and the screams of others reverberate in my chest. I don't bother to look back.</p>
        <p>
A few more shots are fired in my direction and a shooting pain rips throughout my thigh and I stumble to the ground. I look down and see blood gushing from the wound. <i>Fuck. I’m only a block from the flat, I should be able to make it. Right?</i> I don’t see anyone chasing after me, so slowly I get up and start limping my way home. I really hope Lauren is okay. The pain is unbearable, but I’m so close.</p>
        <p>
“Come on, Sasha. Keep pushing.” I say to myself.</p>
        <p>
I stumble into the entryway of the tenement, and come face to face with the stairs. It’s only a three floor building, but <i>why the fuck did we chose to live on the top floor?</i>
