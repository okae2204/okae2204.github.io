Thank you for checking out the site files. idk why you'd subject yourself to this but here you are. This project started out for a class portofolio, an extreme parinoia, a severe hatred of google services, and my insanity yelling at me to learn how to self host everything. Sorry in advance.

Changelog:
    Version 0.10:
        First Release! Why tf am I doing this.

notes:
    not compatible with zen-browser for some reason. I have no idea why it's not, but I'm not experienced enough to figure it out. sorry.
    
    sudo pacman -S firefox is a great command though
